# Mean Value Theorem
If for $a < b \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f:[a,b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where f is conintuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$, then there exists a $c \in (a,b)$ such that 

\begin{equation} f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \end{equation}

For the proof of this, we need something called the **Cauchy Mean Value Theorem**. The CMVT states that for a f,g idential to above, and such that $g'(x) \neq  \forall x \in(a,b)$ and $ f(a) = 0, g(a) = 0 $, there exists a $c \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 

\begin{equation} \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'{c}} \end{equation}


Now at the end of the day, we want to show that $\frac{f(b)}{g(b)} = \frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$. We can multiply across and then subtract to get:
\begin{equation} f(b)g'(c) -g(b)f'(c) = 0 \end{equation}
