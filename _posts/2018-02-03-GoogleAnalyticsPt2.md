This is the second set of notes I'm writing, just for myself to keep my attention on the task at hand.
## Navigating Google Analytics (2.1)
This is just a guided tour of the interface
## Understanding Overview reports (2.2)
This is just a guided tour of the interface...again
## Understanding Full Reports (2.3)
The summary view gives you: 
- Aquisition
- Behavior
- Conversions

You can also add something called a 'secondary dimension' to your view. This allows you to sift through things like 'device category.'

Dropdown menus are great. 
## Sharing Reports (2.4)
This is just a guided tour of the interface...again...again. Ez.
## Dashboards
Customization > Dashboards. 

Dashboards are useful for metrics and charts you may want to use reguarly without having to customize constantly. Of course you can also make it prettier.
