I'm an efficiency geek. I like to work to make things not only well, but as quickly as possible.

### I've worked with...

Linux, Python, R (in order of decreasing confidence). I've also worked with TensorFlow using the Keras wrapper for some basic deep learning, and know my way around plotting using ggplot2.
