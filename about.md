I'm Darpan. I work at the WWE as a data scientist, making things work that range from cutting edge natural language processing to your run of the mill ETL processes. 

### I've worked with...

Linux, Python, R (in order of decreasing confidence). NLTK is a good friend, and know my way around plotly.
